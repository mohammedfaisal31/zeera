During the times of pandemic like COVID-19, it is required that there should be minimum or no social contact between people. In a typical restaurant, there is always a contact between the customer and the same menu card used by a lot of other customers  as the host has to receive the order from the customer by listing out the menu.    To avoid this,  there is a technical solution to this problem and that is to replace  the ‘menu card’ with a digital menu. The customer will be given a QR code at his table.He/she scans the code,it will generate a link which in technical terms is the HTTP request by the client and the Server responds to the request and serves a Web page to the customer at the client side .This page lists the food items available at the restaurant  and thereby minimizes the risk of the spread of VIRUS.  On the technical side, the webapp has the feature to insert,delete and update the items to the menu periodically as per the requirement.
